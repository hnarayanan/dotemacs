# Shoo, here be dragons.

There is nothing of interest in this repository. It is simply a cache
of my arcane Emacs configuration.

## Notes

In the process of moving from my older manual setup to
[Melpa](https://melpa.org), the following packages have been
removed. They can be brought back when needed:

- Slime
- ESS
- Artist mode
- Feature mode (for Cucumber)
