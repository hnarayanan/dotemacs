# Shoo, here be dragons.

There is nothing of interest in this repository. It simply exists as a
cache of my arcane emacs configuration as I attempt to migrate it to
the current day using [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

## Notes

In this process, the following packages have been removed. They can be
brought back when needed:

- Slime
- ESS
- Artist mode
- Feature mode (for Cucumber)

Languages that probably need major modes:

- [x] shell
- [-] applescript
- [x] C/C++
- [ ] python
- [x] ruby
- [x] go
- [x] php
- [x] latex
- [-] bison and flex
- [x] yaml
- [x] html
- [x] css
- [x] js
- [x] octave/matlab
