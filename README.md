# Shoo, here be dragons.

There is nothing of interest in this repository. It simply exists as a
cache of my arcane emacs configuration as I attempt to migrate it to
the current day using [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

## Notes

Things to try:

- [ ] elpy et al. for Python
- [ ] helm as a replacement for ido
- [ ] smex to enhance M-x

In this process, the following packages have been removed. They can be
brought back when needed:

- Slime
- ESS
- Artist mode
- Feature mode (for Cucumber)
