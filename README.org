#+TITLE: GNU Emacs Configuration

I've always had a natural affinity for the native text-editing
interface in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. The shortcuts (called key-bindings in Emacs
terminology) and mnemonic patterns make intuitive sense to me. So for
nearly 2.5 decades, I happily used Emacs as "just a text editor."

In late 2023, I decided to immerse myself in the world of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Emacs Lisp]].
This really wasn't driven by any specific goal; it was simply me
encouraging my curiosity. It was around this time that it hit me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs is not a text editor, it's a tool construction kit that lets you
build any text-based tool you want. /It is the embodiment of a
philosophy of user empowerment./
#+END_QUOTE

As I've explored the implications of this idea, my Emacs configuration
has evolved significantly. It's no longer limited to a handful of
snippets I've cribbed from the internet. It now involves multiple
packages, relies on [[https://melpa.org][a package repository]], leans into powerful systems
built upon Emacs (like [[https://magit.vc][Magit]] and [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]]), and most importantly,
adapts Emacs to be exactly what I need it to be.

This file gathers all these ideas in one place, and it aims to be two
things simultaneously:

- Literature that is readable and understandable for humans.
- A resource that can be directly exported (=C-c C-v t= in Org Mode)
  to my actual Emacs configuration files.

The structure of this file was inspired by [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs][a much richer literate
configuration by Prot]].

[[mailto:mail@harishnarayanan.org][Please write to me]] if you need any help with how it's used, or if
you'd like to suggest any improvements.

#+toc: headlines 3

* Early Initialisation

There are some things (mostly pertinent to the base UI) that need to
be set really early in Emacs' startup. This is so that the UI doesn't
first show up uncustomised, and then /flash/ as it redraws based on any
later UI customisation (such as a change of theme).

This early initialisation configuration goes into a handily-named file
called =early-init.el=.

** Clean Slate

Depending on your system, there might be some default configuration
shared by other Emacs users in a file called =default.el=. To ensure
our Emacs behaves consistently everywhere, we ignore this and start
from a blank slate.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(setq inhibit-default-init t)
#+END_SRC

** Minimal Interface

There are a few elements like a graphical menu and a scroll-bar that
are useful for beginners when first getting acquainted with Emacs. But
as you get more experienced navigating the app with a keyboard, they
get less useful. As a more advanced user, I remove them from the UI to
let me focus more on the content.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

In the snippet above, =-1= is convention for disabling the
corresponding mode.

** macOS System Integration

I generally use Emacs on macOS, and this needs me to tweak it a tiny
bit to my liking.

*** Resolve native compilation issues

To be as fast as possible, modern Emacs /byte compiles/ Emacs Lisp
code into an efficient format for use at runtime. For some reason, on
my Mac, Emacs fails to fully understand where GCC is installed, and
then complains that it cannot find =libgccjit.so= very many times when
installing packages.

No matter, we help it along by explicitly telling it where to look.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "/opt/local/bin")
  (setenv "PATH" (concat "/opt/local/bin:" (getenv "PATH"))))
#+END_SRC

The paths above are hard-coded for [[https://www.macports.org][MacPorts]] and you can tweak them for
your system if it's different.

*** Set the Command key to function as the Meta key

Emacs has two primary modifier keys, the Control key (=C=) and the
Meta key (=M=). =M= is traditionally mapped to =Alt= on most
keyboards, but on a Mac, =Command= is so much more comfortable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta
        mac-option-modifier 'none))
#+END_SRC

*** Reduce window decoration

These settings make Emacs' titlebar blend more seamlessly with the
dark theme. Enforcing night mode ensures that title is in a colour
that is visible against the dark titlebar.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark)))
#+END_SRC

** Performance Optimisation

*** Reduce pauses from garbage collection

As Emacs runs, it allocates memory from the operating system to store
the data it needs. When tasks complete, not all of this data needs to
persist and can be discarded. To find and reclaim this unused memory,
Emacs runs a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Garbage-Collection.html][garbage collection]] process after:

- a certain number of bytes have been allocated, or
- a certain fraction of the current heap size has been used up

since the previous garbage collection.

The trouble is, the default thresholds for these are quite low, e.g.
800,000 bytes (~800 kB) on a 64-bit computer. This means garbage
collection triggers unnecessarily often, causing noticeable pauses
that slow things down.

To address this, we follow an approach that traces back to [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-11/msg00761.html][Andrea
Corallo]]. We defer garbage collection entirely during startup and
minibuffer activity to keep the experience snappy, then restore it to
a reasonable threshold (64 MB) for normal editing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum
      gc-cons-percentage 1.0)

(defconst hn/gc-normal-threshold (* 64 1024 1024)) ;; 64MB
(defconst hn/gc-normal-percentage 0.1)

(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq gc-cons-threshold hn/gc-normal-threshold
                  gc-cons-percentage hn/gc-normal-percentage)))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook
          (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook
          (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold hn/gc-normal-threshold
                           gc-cons-percentage hn/gc-normal-percentage)))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Reduce number of files touched during startup

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(defvar hn/file-name-handler-alist-backup file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq file-name-handler-alist
                  (delete-dups (append file-name-handler-alist
                                       hn/file-name-handler-alist-backup)))))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Speed up package loading

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(setq package-quickstart t)
#+END_SRC

* Meta Configuration

** Separate =customize= settings

In addition to being configured with the source code in this file,
Emacs can also be configured using a graphical interface (=M-x
customize=). When using this GUI, the standard behaviour is to persist
these settings directly by editing the default Emacs config file.

The following configuration puts this into its own file, so we can
clearly separate these two concepts.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(setq custom-file (locate-user-emacs-file "custom.el"))
(load custom-file 'noerror 'nomessage)
#+END_SRC

* Package Management

In addition to the packages that come built-in with Emacs, there is a
lot out there that can add to its functionality. We turn to a popular,
community-driven package repository called [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]] to access this
goodness.

** Repository Configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

** =use-package= Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(require 'use-package)
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Optimisation Notes

In the sections that follow, I use =use-package= to install, configure
and load multiple packages. Loading all packages at startup can slow
things down significantly (adding multiple seconds to startup time).

To identify which packages are slowing things down, I temporarily
enable statistics collection by adding =(setq
use-package-compute-statistics t)= at the top of =init.el=. After
restarting Emacs, I run =M-x use-package-report= to see a table of
package load times sorted by duration.

Armed with this data, I selectively defer expensive packages so they
only load when actually needed. The configurations below reflect this
optimisation. I've deferred heavy packages to keep startup fast.

* Appearance and Interface

I like seeing the current buffer name and the machine I'm on right in
the title bar, so I don’t lose track when I have multiple frames or
hosts open.

** Frame and Window Behaviour
*** Frame title format

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(setq frame-title-format
      (concat  "%b - emacs@" (system-name)))
#+END_SRC

***  Startup screen preferences

I prefer a relatively clean and empty state as I start, so the
following removes a startup splash screen and brings up an empty plain
text buffer, so I can start typing immediately.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
(setq initial-scratch-message "")
(setq initial-major-mode 'text-mode)
(setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Window splitting preferences

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
;; (setq split-width-threshold 0)
#+END_SRC

** Theme Configuration

The basic visual styling of my Emacs is controlled by a highly
accessible theme called [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][Modus Vivendi Tritanopia]]. A version of this
theme comes built-in with Emacs, but it is not the most up-to-date
version. We fetch the most recent version from the package repository
and customise it a little. This is a highly customisable theme with
many options, but I try to keep it simple.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(use-package modus-themes
  :config

  (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
        modus-themes-bold-constructs t
        modus-themes-prompts '(bold)
        modus-themes-to-toggle '(modus-operandi-tritanopia modus-vivendi-tritanopia)
        modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
        '((border-mode-line-active bg-mode-line-active)
          (border-mode-line-inactive bg-mode-line-inactive))
        modus-themes-headings
        '((1 . (1.2))
          (2 . (1.1))
          (agenda-date . (1.1))
          (agenda-structure . (1.2))
          (t . (1.0))))

  (modus-themes-load-theme 'modus-vivendi-tritanopia)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle))
#+END_SRC

** Visual Feedback Systems

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(transient-mark-mode 1)
(delete-selection-mode 1)
(setq show-paren-delay 0)
(show-paren-mode 1)
(column-number-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
** Whitespace and Buffer Boundaries
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t
              indicate-empty-lines t
              indicate-buffer-boundaries 'right
              sentence-end-double-space nil)
#+END_SRC

#+END_SRC

#+END_SRC

* Minibuffer and Completion

The following turns on old-school minibuffer completion. We will
replace it with Vertico and family later.

** Minibuffer Interfaces

*** File and Buffer Navigation

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
;; turn on interactive do

      ido-everywhere t)
#+END_SRC

*** Command Execution

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(use-package smex)
;; enable smex
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-X") 'smex-major-mode-commands)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c M-x") 'execute-extended-command)
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Modern Minibuffer Stack

The minibuffer is the small interface at the bottom of the Emacs
window where you can enter commands, input parameters, see results of
these commands and so on. The [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-02-17-emacs-modern-minibuffer-packages/][internet suggests that]] with the
following packages, it will be much more functional: Vertico, Consult,
Marginalia, Embark, embark-consult, wgrep. Also consider savehist and
recentf.

At the moment I only use interactive-do, which is awesome but also
like 90 years old.
